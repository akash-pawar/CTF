--> An image was leaked from a babies store. the manager is so annoyed because he needs to identify the image to fire charges against the responsible employee. the key is the md5 of the image

	a) first use strings command and see both head and tail.
		> strings 'find the image.pcap' | head -11

cybertalent_forencis# strings 'find the image.pcap' | head -11

Hey bro
S\U
Sup supp, are we ready
yeah, u got the files?
yes but i think the channel is not secured
the UTM will block the file transfer as the DLP module is active
ok we can use cryptcat
ok what the password then
let it be P@ssawordaya
hhh, ok
listen on 7070 and ill send you the file , bye


	b) with wireshark lets filter "tcp.port == 7070"
	    > now download raw of image.pcap

	c) Then open a netcat client on localhost:
		> netcat localhost 7070 < crypted.file

	d) And open a cryptcat listener on localhost:
		> cryptcat -l -k P@ssawordaya -p 7070 > decrypted.file

	e) here you get decrypted image but there is nothing called as flag,
	   > the md5sum of image is a flag.
